Introduction

Welcome to Lib41 for the HP-41 calculator! Lib41 is a collection of
routines that can be easily imported to your own module.


Library
=======

This is a library and not a module. It builds into an archive library
that you can link with your own module. This allows you to pick the
routines you actually need for your module without having to drag in a
lot of other things.


Background
==========

Creating your own module for the HP-41 has never been easier. It may
even be desirable to make one as there are many good routines out
there, but they may be in different modules and having dependencies on
a wide range of modules can become cumbersome.

By rolling your own module, you can optimize it to your own
use-case. Maybe others will like it too, so do not be afraidto share
it.

It can also be that you have some good routines of your own, but it is
not enough to warrant a complete module. Finding material to include
in your module can result in a lot of work. By using Lib41 you can
hopefully find good routines to complement your own routines and
provide a richer and more complete result. On the other hand, there
is probably not a good idea to wildly include things just for the sake
of it. Include things that makes sense to you and that may be a good
fit for what you are doing.

By providing Lib41, it is hoped that a decent amount of useful source
code can be collected in one place. This makes it easier to keep track
of it, study it and make good use of it.
